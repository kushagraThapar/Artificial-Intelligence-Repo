# Artificial-Intelligence-Repo
This is repo for artificial intelligence assignments

This is a readme file:

The Programs are written in Java (version JRE-1.8)

To run the programs, first you need to compile them using JRE 1.8

There are 2 files which you need to compile

1. BFSExecutionClass.java
2. DFSExecutionClass.java

Commands to compile the programs are:
For BFS Algorithm: javac BFSExecutionClass.java

For DFS Algorithm: javac DFSExecutionClass.java

To run the programs, commands are:

1. For BFS Algorithm:

java BFSExecutionClass <optional parameter as input string representing the initial state of the 8-puzzle problem, If not given, the program uses default value as “724506831”>

2. For DFS Algorithm:

java DFSExecutionClass <optional parameter as input string representing the initial state of the 8-puzzle problem, If not given, the program uses default value as “724506831”>
